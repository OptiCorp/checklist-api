- since we have the inventory app dealing with the items, parts, assemblies, etc. I think all those models can be removed

- I think the model I originally created and the one you're still using for punch is outdated. It's pointing to a section when perhaps should just point to the checklist

- I think the section/question models I created are over-engineered for what we need, forcing you to flat them out. We should re-think them, perhaps having 2 models: 
    section and question (or other names if you think of anything better)

- You mentioned parts are part of the scope of the inventory api, given that I think we should not have parts in this microservice
    - when a user wants to create a new template, we need to send an event to the inventory api to validate if it exists, before creating it
    - the section knows which part it refers to

- Same for the user, I think we should only use the user's id
